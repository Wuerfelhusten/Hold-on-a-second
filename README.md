# Hold on a Sec

A simple SKSE plugin for Skyrim SE/AE that lets you open the pause menu while in dialogue.  
Useful if you want to save, tweak settings, or just step away without being locked into a conversation.

## Features
- Open the system menu during NPC dialogue.
- Dialogue resumes normally after closing the menu.
- Script-free, lightweight SKSE plugin.

## Requirements
- Skyrim SE or AE
- [SKSE64](https://skse.silverlock.org/)

## Notes
This is my first SKSE project — I don’t know the internals very deeply, but it works reliably in practice.  
Should be safe to install/uninstall at any time.

## Credits
- SkyHorizon3 for providing a working way of reliably opening the journal without breaking it
